  <h2 class = "left">About this Game</h2>
  <p class = "left">This project was made possible by ChatGPT. Most of the coding was done by ChatGPT, with some prompting on my part.</p>
  <p class = "left">This project was also inspired somewhat by the creator of <a href = "https://sumplete.com">sumplete.com</a>, Daniel Tait. I first got the idea of using ChatGPT to make this game from him.</p>
  <p class = "left">I wanted to make something like a game where there's a maze and you had to navigate through it, and every time you played, it was different.</p>
  <p class = "left">So I got to work, and began prompting ChatGPT to make a game. At first, I had no idea what I was doing, so my first prompt and response was: </p>
  <img src = "first.png" width = "800px" height = "500px" />
  <p class = "left">which gave me this: </p>
  <img src = "second.png" width = "600px" height = "600px" />
  <p class = "left">Just an empty square with a red square that the player can move around. So ChatGPT and I had a long way to go.</p>
  <p class = "left">The full version history is on display at <a href = "version.html">this link</a>, but after multiple prompting and retries (after hours), this is the result:</p>
  <img src = "third.png" width = "600px" height = "600px" />
  <p class = "left">This was the first version of the smaller randomly generated maze that worked properly. After this milestone, I proceeded to add an expanded maze, and added titles, timers, and the end screens.</p>
  <p class = "left">At one point, the chat file had gotten too big that my computer was getting noticeably getting slower, so I had to open up a fresh chat and continue coding.</p>
  <p class = "left">After a very long week, we had finally landed on version 1.0 of The Traze Maze!</p>
  <p class = "left">Big thanks to ChatGPT for coding this game, and thanks to you for playing this game and reading this article!</p>
