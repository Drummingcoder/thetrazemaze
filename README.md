# The Traze Maze

A maze game made by me. Still under development.
Hopefully, this game can turn out to be a combination between a shooter and a platformer game and the element of a maze mixed in. 

This game is a level by level game that you have to navigate the maze using arrow keys or WASD to reach the end.
